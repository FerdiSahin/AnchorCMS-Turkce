# What is GhostRAV?
GhostRAV is a **GRAV** theme. 

## Why did I do it?
Because the Casper template is really well designed. I integrated this template into GRAV because I wanted to use it on my site.

## Installation

Okay, now let's just explain how it will be established.

1. Download the template.
2. Extract the files from the zip.
3. Copy the theme to / user / themes /.
4. From the Admin panel, scroll to the themes section and activate GhostRAV.
5. If there is an error, you can send feedback. If not, you can start using it.
